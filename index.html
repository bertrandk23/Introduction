  <h1>Bertrand Kirkland Jr. Bio</h1>
  <h2>About Me </h2>
  
  <p>
"Hello, my name is Bertrand Kirkland Jr! I am the only child of both Bertrand Kirkland Sr. and Ella Kirkland. I was born July 22th 1987 in Tyler, Tx. I am a full time student at San Diego Global Knowledge University where I am pursuing my dreams of becoming a entry level software developer. I have always desired to work in the computer field but life has a way of giving us what we need before what we want. I am also a full time father to a family of five daughters. <br>Thats right, I have my work cut out for me.</p>
